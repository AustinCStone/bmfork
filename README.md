## Decentralized Detection of AI Generated Content
Rapid advancements in generative AI have led to a massive proliferation of synthetic media that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic content, posing significant challenges for the integrity of digital information and the trust that underpins modern society.

To address this growing challenge, SN34 aims to create the most accurate fully-generalized detection system. Here, fully-generalized means that the system is capable of detecting both synthetic and semi-synthetic media from all known generative architectures. Our incentive mechanism evolves alongside state-of-the-art generative AI, rewarding miners whose detection algorithms are the most accurate across all cutting-edge generative models.


## Core Components

**Miners** 
- Miners are tasked with running binary classifiers that discern between genuine and AI-generated content, and are rewarded based on their accuracy. 
- Miners predict a float value in [0., 1.], with values greater than 0.5 indicating the image or video is AI generated. 
- Miners are rewarded based on their accuracy.


**Validators** 
- Validators challenge miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic media drawn from a diverse pool of sources
- We continuously add new datasets and generative models to our validators in order to maximize the coverage of the types of media miners are incentivized to detect.
