**IMPORTANT**: If you are new to Bittensor, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics on the [Bittensor Website](https://bittensor.com/) before proceeding.

**Overview:**
The BitMind Subnet leverages advanced generative and discriminative AI models within the Bittensor network to detect AI-generated images and videos. 

**Purpose:**
As generative AI technology advances rapidly, the creation of sophisticated synthetic media has become increasingly prevalent and accessible. This surge in AI-generated content poses significant challenges for content authenticity and digital trust. The BitMind Subnet enables reliable identification of AI-generated media, helping preserve the authenticity and credibility of digital content across the internet.

**Features:**

- **Infinitely Fine-Tunable:** Our incentive mechanism evolves alongside state-of-the-art generative AI, rewarding only miners whose detection algorithms account for the latest models

**Core Components:**

- **Miners** Tasked with running binary classifiers that discern between genuine and AI-generated content.
  - Predict a float value in [0., 1.], with predictions > 0.5 indicating the image or video is AI-generated
  - Miners run both a image detection model and a video detection model 

- **Validators:** Responsible for challenging miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic media, drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
  - We continuously add new datasets and generative models to our validators in order to maximize the coverage of the types of media our miners are incentivized to detect.
